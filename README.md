# schrodinger_WKB

This code compares the exact solution of a mathematical problem with its WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation. The exact solution and the WKB approximation are calculated using Bessel functions and complex exponential functions, respectively. The code computes the values of the exact solution and the WKB approximation for a range of input values (`x`) and a fixed epsilon (`epsilon = 0.5`).

After computing the solutions, the code calculates the relative error between the exact solution and the WKB approximation. The relative error is a measure of the difference between the two solutions, normalized by the exact solution.

Finally, the code visualizes the results by plotting the exact solution and the WKB approximation on the same graph. The x-axis represents the input values, and the y-axis represents the solutions. The plot also includes a legend to indicate which curve corresponds to the exact solution and which curve corresponds to the WKB approximation.
