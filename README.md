## README for Quantum Mechanics WKB Visualization Script

This Python script visualizes the exact solution and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation in a quantum mechanics context, using `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `scipy` libraries. It generates linearly spaced numbers for the x-range, computes exact and WKB solutions based on Bessel functions, and calculates their relative error. The script plots these solutions for comparison, showing the effectiveness of the WKB approximation against the exact solution. Users can adjust the `epsilon` value for different scenarios, and the plot displays both solutions over a specified range of `omega` values.
